# car_project_v2
Updated car project with new functionality - front and backend
CRUD - MERN
MobX as state manager.
It's fullstack application which alowes user to fetch car data (brands and models) from MongoDB.
It has basic CRUD operations implemented on both sides (frontend and backend).
Models component of the app have functionalities like Filtering, Pagination and Sorting.
It need code refactoring, but I would add that I used some of these techs for the first time.
